# Advanced microscope LED ring light
 Microscope LED light + Arduino Nano + some potis = AMLRL

Based on a 24 RGBW WS2812 LED Ring is this microscope light extended to control

- cold white (as sum of RGB) from off to full bright 
- warm white 
- number of leds that are on
- position of the first led 

So you can bring the light partially to the object, from all directions.
Very nice to read writings on chips and components.

Possible extentions:

- add support to control full colors
